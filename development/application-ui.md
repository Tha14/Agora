# Application UI Contract

Status: authoritative development contract, 2026-08-15.

This document owns durable application-level UI behavior that is not part of message generation,
citations, semantic search, or Web Search. Current explicit user requirements override older
presentation code and translations.

## 1. Motion ownership and accessibility

Application UI motion consumes the shared Agora motion policy. Spatial press, size, and scale motion
must snap to the stable resting presentation when Reduced Motion disables spatial transitions.
Opacity-only transitions may remain only where their owning component contract allows them.

A screen may reuse an established motion language directly without creating another global animation
owner. Interaction state stays local to the interactive control and must not alter navigation,
validation, persistence, or completion semantics.

## 2. Onboarding primary action

The onboarding Continue/Get Started action preserves its full-width role, page validation, paging,
completion callback, enabled state, colors, and label semantics.

The action has no custom press-driven size, inset, or content-scale animation. It remains at its
stable geometry of 32 dp horizontal inset, 48 dp height, and 1f content scale while pressed and at
rest. The ordinary Material Button indication remains available, but the action does not own a
`MutableInteractionSource`, pressed-state collector, spring, tween, or other custom press-motion
state. Its existing outer layout, shape, color, enabled state, navigation, and completion behavior
remain unchanged.

## 3. Settings category copy

The Generation Settings category description names only its actual category content and is the direct
localized equivalent of `LLM parameters`. It must not mention the context window. This copy change
does not remove or relocate Context Settings, alter the Generation Settings destination, or change
any stored generation parameter.

The default resource and every supported locale must define the same key set. App-owned strings are
localized in the current Android locale; hard-coded English must not replace resource-backed UI copy.

## 4. Chat composer dropdown icon parity

The chat-bottom attachment `+` dropdown and tools `...` dropdown use explicit 24 dp leading
icons/images in every menu row, matching the Material default size used by the user-message
long-press dropdown. Their 16 dp trigger icons remain unchanged. Menu shape, row geometry, 12 dp
icon-label gap, labels, badges, switches, ordering, enablement, and click behavior remain unchanged.

## 5. Chat bottom-bar answer fade

In normal, non-expanded composer mode, the existing 40 dp vertical fade is an alpha mask on the
conversation foreground, not a separately painted background-color cover. Its zero lead, normal-only
12 dp host lift, measured bottom-bar height, and animated composer-expansion spacer place the mask at
the same screen coordinates as the existing fade without moving the chat-bottom Surface or changing
`bottomBarHeightPx`. The mask uses offscreen `DstIn` composition: conversation pixels stay opaque above
the fade, become transparent through the 40 dp band, and remain transparent behind the composer, so
the one actual `AnimatedBlobBackground` below is revealed pixel-for-pixel even while it moves. Normal
mode must not sample, duplicate, freeze, or paint over that dynamic background. List/answer padding,
IME/navigation insets, composer-expansion spacer ownership, and scroll ownership remain unchanged.
Expanded composer mode receives no lift and retains its exact background-color cover with 20 dp
compact-at-screen-top gradient geometry.

## 6. MCP page-entry refresh

Entering the MCP Settings page submits exactly one refresh request for every enabled server with a
nonblank URL, except a server already in CONNECTING state. The page delegates through the ViewModel to
the process-wide `McpRegistry`; it does not create another connection authority. Public refresh entry
points return without holding the Registry lock or constructing or closing a client on the caller
thread. Runtime, client, and transport construction, replacement, close, and connection work run on
the Registry's IO dispatcher under the process-wide AppContainer `appScope`, so page destruction does
not cancel an accepted refresh.

Page-entry requests are single-flight per exact server configuration. A second page-entry refresh
coalesces with an active connection or pending build for that configuration. Every build receives a
monotonic generation ticket, and installation plus snapshot publication require the ticket, current
configuration, enabled state, nonblank URL, and runtime identity to remain current. A removed,
disabled, or replaced configuration therefore fences out stale build, connection, and error results;
stale clients are closed without replacing the newer runtime or snapshot.

Recomposition and navigation within the page's editor do not retrigger refresh. No timer, delay loop,
WorkManager job, alarm, service, background observer, or periodic polling participates. Existing
Settings reconciliation, snapshot StateFlow, retry backoff, manual refresh, and runtime identity
checks remain authoritative.

## 7. Localized category and Thinking-segment labels

The default resource and all eleven supported locale directories define localized values for
`context_title`, `context_desc`, `thinking_segment_display_mode`,
`thinking_segment_display_mode_desc`, `thinking_segment_display_card`,
`thinking_segment_display_bottom_sheet`, and `thinking_segments_title`. Localized resources must
not retain the default English text for those keys, and placeholder sets remain identical.

## 7. Appearance token-detail cleanup

Appearance does not expose the obsolete Detailed token usage toggle. ChatApp, MessageList,
MessageItem, and AssistantMessageContent do not collect or thread that unused UI value. The existing
stored preference key and settings import/export compatibility remain readable and writable so the UI
cleanup creates no migration or archive incompatibility.

## 8. Image-transcription model chooser

The primary image-transcription model chooser lists only currently enabled concrete models. It does
not inject a synthetic `No model`/null-selection row. A previously persisted null value remains
compatible: the settings summary may still show its existing no-model fallback, and nullable
settings persistence/import behavior remains unchanged.

## 9. Appearance Thinking-segment row order

When the Thinking segment display setting is available, Appearance places it immediately below the
Thought and Tool Blocks display setting and before Auto-Expand Active Group. Reordering must not
change the existing Grouped/Compact availability rule, the exact Grouped + Card Auto-Expand rule, or
any stored/effective display-mode behavior.

## 10. Settings destination rows without redundant arrows

Top-level Settings category cards do not render a right-arrow icon; the entire existing card remains
the navigation target with unchanged grouping, padding, labels, descriptions, colors, and spacing.
The Terminal page's enabled-only Manage sandbox row likewise omits only its trailing Chevron while
preserving the row click destination and the separate Sandbox enable Switch. Provider Settings omits
right arrows from built-in Provider rows, custom Provider rows, and Local Models. Custom Provider rows
retain their protocol badge but omit the spacer that existed solely between that badge and its arrow.
No destination, summary, tint, enablement, persistence, or other trailing control changes.

## 11. Full-screen text-file preview typography

The full-screen Markdown-file preview renders its content with the current effective App font from
`MaterialTheme.typography`; it does not replace that font with a hard-coded mono or system family.
Markdown body/list/table text, H1-H6, block code, and inline code preserve their current font sizes and
use exactly 1.1 times their source line height. H1-H6 are explicitly Bold. Link text inherits the
containing paragraph typography.

The ordinary-text preview also uses the current effective App font while retaining its exact 13 sp
font size and 20 sp line height. The already-bold filename overlay, close control, selection, scrolling,
HTML handling, link behavior, Markdown components, content padding, and file-type routing remain
unchanged.

Every full-screen preview subtype enters and exits through one of two shared top-level transition
hosts: the media host covers loading, single video, PDF, mixed image/video paging, and single image;
the text host covers Markdown and ordinary text. With spatial transitions enabled, both hosts use the
same entrance of a 220 ms fade plus a 300 ms center scale from 0.96f to 1f with
`FastOutSlowInEasing`, and the same exit of a 180 ms fade plus a 220 ms center scale from 1f to
0.96f with `FastOutLinearInEasing`. Reduced Motion retains only the corresponding timed fades.

The hosts keep their last payload through exit and release the top-level presentation owner only after
the transition settles. A confirmed video page alone retains the viewer-internal 400 ms player fade
before handing off to the shared top-level exit. Image, PDF, loading, and unresolved media pages hand
off immediately without a pager-owned delay. The mixed-media pager has no duplicate close timer or
second `onClose` owner. Media decoding, pager navigation, gestures, payload routing, shared exit
transitions, and Reduced Motion remain unchanged.

## 12. PDF page rasterization

PDF page rasterization uses the existing framework `PdfRenderer` owner for both selected pages sent
as model attachments and all-page full-screen preview generation. Every newly allocated
`ARGB_8888` page bitmap is initialized to opaque white before
`PdfRenderer.Page.render` receives it. This produces a deterministic white paper background for
PDF regions that do not paint an explicit background and prevents JPEG encoding from flattening
transparent black pixels into a black page that hides correctly rendered black glyphs.

Both consumers share one bitmap-initialization path. The change does not alter page dimensions,
1536 px long-edge scaling, JPEG quality 80, filename/storage ownership, selected-page filtering and
ordering, preview page limits, progress callbacks, cancellation cleanup, page-count behavior,
PDF-authored colors or backgrounds, viewer motion, or attachment/LLM routing. A different PDF engine
or dependency is not introduced without separate evidence of a rendering defect that remains after
opaque-white initialization.

## 13. Full-screen media window layering

A media preview opened from any Dialog-backed Bottom Sheet owns a subsequently created full-screen,
edge-to-edge Dialog window. Window order is source Bottom Sheet below media viewer below the
viewer-owned Image Actions Bottom Sheet created by long press. Compose `zIndex` is never treated as a
cross-window ordering mechanism. Closing the viewer reveals the still-owned source sheet unless that
sheet independently dismissed.

The media Dialog draws one full-size, unscaled black backdrop, disables system window dimming, and
owns that backdrop's alpha through the same retained visibility transition. The backdrop fades from
transparent to black on entry and black to transparent on exit while the media-content layer keeps the
existing shared fade/scale transition. Closing therefore reveals the underlying owner continuously
instead of holding a fully black frame until Dialog destruction, while a content scale below 1f still
cannot expose the square corners of a scaled black rectangle. Exact transition durations/easings,
last-payload retention, Reduced Motion, pager gestures, and confirmed-video-only close waiting remain
unchanged. The long-press Image Actions sheet remains a modal window created after and above the media
Dialog. Its system window dim is disabled so the sheet-owned animated scrim is the only black overlay;
long press must not introduce a one-frame opaque dim flash before the scrim fade.

## 14. Composer clipboard images

The Chat composer TextField participates in Compose Foundation receive-content dispatch for
`image/*`. A clipboard paste may contribute one or multiple URI-backed images. Handled image items
immediately enter the existing `ChatComposerState.onPickImages` private-copy, progress, rejection,
preview, removal, draft, and send lifecycle; transient clipboard URIs are never persisted as the
attachment's durable path.

Only supported image URI items are consumed. Text and every unsupported clipboard item are returned
to the TextField/platform so native text paste, cursor replacement, selection, undo, IME, and
accessibility behavior remain intact. A mixed clipboard payload can therefore insert its text at the
current selection and add its images as attachments. MIME resolution is defensive and copy failure
uses localized existing/new attachment rejection presentation without crashing or leaving a phantom
attachment.

## 16. Drawer conversation-list loading and search progress

The conversation drawer observes only the conversation fields required by navigation, selection, display, and the system-prompt dialog; it never materializes draft text, draft attachment metadata, or branch-selection blobs for that list. Its first emitted snapshot is loading, distinct from a genuinely empty library, and a motion-aware circular indicator fades in and out over the list area.

Conversation search exposes a separate in-flight state from the moment a nonblank query is accepted through debounce and the existing literal/semantic query. Its circular indicator fades in and out in the search field, does not alter query debounce or ranking, and cancellation, clearing, or failure cannot leave a stuck indicator. The retained prior result may remain visible while a new query is pending.

The drawer's first-list state is not a second conversation authority or a new search architecture; Room remains the durable source and the existing search methods remain authoritative.

## 15. Verification

Focused verification must cover the onboarding action's fixed 32 dp inset and 48 dp height, absence
of custom press-size/inset/content-scale state, and unchanged action semantics, Generation Settings description, locale key/value
parity for the Context and Thinking-segment labels, absence of the removed context-window wording,
24 dp leading-icon parity across both chat-bottom dropdowns without resizing their triggers, absence
of the Detailed token usage Appearance row and dead chat-side parameter threading, the Tool Blocks ->
Thinking segment -> Auto-Expand Appearance row order with unchanged predicates, the normal-only
0 dp gradient lead with unchanged 40 dp width and 20 dp expanded behavior, and scoped Settings-arrow
absence with preserved category/Sandbox/Provider click destinations, Sandbox Switch, and custom
protocol badge. PDF rasterization verification must cover one shared opaque-white bitmap initializer
used by both render paths, initialization before every framework page render, and unchanged
scaling/JPEG/page-selection/progress/cancellation behavior. Full-screen text-preview verification
must cover current App-font inheritance in
both Markdown and ordinary-text paths, exact 1.1 Markdown line-height scaling, explicit Bold H1-H6,
unchanged Markdown font sizes, and the unchanged 13 sp / 20 sp ordinary-text metrics. It must also
cover both shared full-screen transition hosts, the exact fade/scale durations and easings, Reduced
Motion's fade-only fallback, last-payload retention, release only after settled exit, confirmed-video
close waiting, immediate non-video handoff, and absence of a duplicate pager close delay. Media
verification also covers Dialog-over-sheet ordering, viewer-owned action-sheet ordering, unscaled
full-screen backdrop, and no scale-below-one corner exposure. Composer verification covers single and
multiple image URI paste, mixed image/text pass-through, unsupported content pass-through, immediate
private-copy routing, and failure cleanup. The project-defined full build gate remains required after
final code or resource changes.
