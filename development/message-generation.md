# Message Generation Architecture Contract

Status: authoritative development contract, 2026-08-13.

This document is required context for every Agora development task. It defines two global and
orthogonal message contracts. Features such as Compact consume these contracts; they must not
create parallel feature-specific definitions.

All software behavior must conform to these contracts, including normal execution, concurrency,
Room transactions, UI projection, errors, Stop/cancellation, recovery, automation, tools, queue
handoff, and legacy compatibility. Conflicting old code, tests, or documentation must be corrected;
they do not authorize a feature-local exception or parallel contract.

Implementation should reuse the existing ordinary pipeline, concepts, state owners, and objects to
the greatest practical extent. Robustness is the primary design objective: contract correctness,
identity fencing, failure atomicity, deterministic recovery, and cancellation safety outrank
cosmetic abstraction. Add an abstraction only for a cohesive invariant, a real side-effect
boundary, or multiple genuine consumers.

## 1. Terms and strict separation

A **generation boundary** identifies the visible messages produced by one generation. It is used
only to locate Regenerate scope and to decide ownership of per-generation status and bottom action
controls.

A **context boundary** identifies the oldest message included in one Provider request. It is used
only by ordinary context/API-path assembly.

The generation-boundary resolver must never select, truncate, reorder, or assemble Provider
context. The context assembler must never infer UI action ownership or Regenerate range.

## 2. Global generation-boundary contract

1. Every real USER message starts a generation boundary, regardless of neighboring message types
   or legacy Run identity.
2. All messages produced inside one generation share one nonblank `runId`. A Run is one indivisible
   generation group; no boundary may be created inside it.
3. A change to a different nonblank `runId` starts a new generation group. Protocol rows,
   Compact rows, and ordinary assistant rows all participate in this Run grouping.
4. Every actual send/generation admission creates a fresh Run ID. It must never reactivate an old
   Run. This includes the Send button, one claimed FIFO queue drain, automatic/manual Compact,
   Recompact, and Regenerate. Provider passes and tool rounds that continue the same admitted
   generation remain inside that generation's Run.
5. Blank legacy Run IDs do not authorize destructive guessing. A real USER remains a hard boundary;
   new writes must always use a nonblank fresh Run ID.

`MessageGenerationBoundaryResolver` is the shared owner of this definition. Compact, Delete,
Recompact, Regenerate, rendering, and status presentation may consume it but may not add local
boundary exceptions.

## 3. UI and Regenerate consequences

- Every real USER message always owns its bottom action controls.
- One Run group owns one generation status presentation.
- The last ordinary assistant output in a Run group owns that group's assistant action controls.
- Adjacent assistants from different Runs remain independently actionable even when an intervening
  Compact is deleted.
- Ordinary Regenerate targets only the selected generation group, creates a fresh Run, and does not
  absorb an adjacent Run.
- Same-position replacement is an output-target option, not a new generation contract. Recompact
  creates a fresh Run and replaces only the selected Compact row at its existing message ID and
  parent. It must not create a branch, clear suffix messages, rewrite descendants, or mutate any
  other message.
- Deleting a Compact deletes only that row and reparents only its direct message children to the
  deleted row's former parent. It must not merge surviving generation groups.

## 4. Global context-boundary contract

For every ordinary Provider request:

1. Start at the request's latest selected parent message.
2. Walk upward through the durable `parentId` chain.
3. The nearest Compact on that chain whose generation ended normally and without error
   (`MessageStatus.SUCCESS`) is the context boundary.
4. That successful Compact is the topmost context message. Older ancestors are excluded.
5. Failed, stopped, in-flight, missing, or off-branch Compact rows are not context boundaries.
6. If no successful Compact exists on the selected ancestor chain, context continues to the oldest
   reachable ancestor.
7. Provider projection may convert the successful Compact capsule into the established summary
   input role, but it must preserve the boundary position and following message order.

`GenerationApiPathBuilder` and the ordinary Provider message projection own this contract.
Manual/automatic Compact and Recompact use this same ordinary path from their requested graph
position. `MessageGenerationBoundaryResolver` has no role here.

## 5. Shared generation lifecycle

Compact is an ordinary generation with only the declared minimal differences: message identity and
UI, haptic exclusion, selected model and generation parameters, tools disabled, Compact system
prompt, and one frozen API-only Compact invocation. It reuses ordinary admission, fresh Run
creation, context/API-path assembly, Provider execution, streaming/checkpoints, Stop/cancellation,
terminal settlement, recovery, and queue release.

The Compact invocation is appended by the shared pre-Provider request projection as the final USER
message. It is request-only configuration: it participates in exact token accounting but is never
written to Room, rendered as a visible message, assigned a Run boundary, or used to alter durable
parentage. The configured Compact summary instructions remain the system prompt; the final USER
turn only invokes that behavior. This guarantees a valid terminal input role even when the durable
Compact parent is an Assistant message.

After a durable tool result and a successful Compact, continuation priority is:

`Compact SUCCESS -> FIFO queued user message -> loop`

The queue claim/check and loop admission must remain linearized so guidance is neither duplicated
nor lost. A non-successful or anomalous Compact is a hard automatic-handoff boundary: it starts
neither queued generation nor loop generation.

## 6. Review blockers

A change is invalid if it:

- uses generation boundaries to assemble Provider context;
- uses context boundaries to merge UI generations or choose Regenerate scope;
- reuses or reactivates a terminal Run for a new send/generation;
- adds a Compact-specific boundary or generation lifecycle;
- adds a Provider descriptor, capabilities/policy object, adapter layer, wrapper, interface, or
  factory without a demonstrated cohesive invariant, real side-effect boundary, or multiple
  genuine stable consumers and without removing an existing responsibility or duplication;
- mutates suffix/neighbor messages during same-position replacement;
- merges actions or status across different Run IDs;
- treats a non-successful Compact as a context boundary.

Focused tests must cover each rule, including legacy blank IDs, protocol rows, failed/stopped
Compact rows, nearest-successful-ancestor selection, fresh-Run Recompact, suffix isolation, and
concurrent queue-versus-loop admission.

## 7. Module boundaries and responsibilities

| Module | Owns | Must not own |
|---|---|---|
| `ChatMessage`, `RunEntity`, status/identity models | Durable vocabulary and small identity predicates. | UI grouping, context walks, orchestration, or side effects. |
| `MessageGenerationBoundaryResolver` | Pure visible-range grouping for one generation by real USER and Run identity. | Context assembly, graph writes, branch mutation, Provider payloads, or Compact-specific rules. |
| `RunUiProjection` | Pure action/status/branch-control presentation derived from generation boundaries. | Generation admission, context selection, or database mutation. |
| `ConversationRuntimeReducer` + `ConversationGenerationState` + mailbox | The single in-process authority for one conversation's slot, accepted effects, Stop barriers, and stale-result rejection. | Provider protocol parsing, Room transaction bodies, or feature-specific context logic. |
| `ConversationExecutionCoordinator` | Per-conversation execution serialization around admitted work. | A second Run state, queue ownership, or result acceptance. |
| `GenerationRequestBuilder` | One immutable admission snapshot: selected model, Provider registry, generation parameters, tools/memory/attachment policy. | Provider execution or live settings reads after admission. |
| `GenerationApiPathBuilder` | Read-only durable parent-chain walk, nearest-successful-Compact context boundary, Provider message projection input, and fixed Provider config. | UI generation boundaries, Run creation, queue policy, or writes. |
| `StandardGenerationContinuationLauncher` | The ordinary fresh-Run graph transaction for a continuation and the optional same-row output target. | A Compact lifecycle, Provider implementation, context reconstruction, or old-Run restart. |
| `BoundRunGenerationLauncher` | Binding one already-created fresh Run to the shared generation tail and identified callbacks. | Run graph creation, boundary inference, or terminal writes outside shared settlement. |
| `GenerationManager` | Mailbox-authorized Provider/tool execution, streaming overlay/checkpoints, generic bounded final text projection, and terminal-effect request. | Branch selection, UI grouping, Compact policy, queue reordering, or independent lifecycle state. |
| `GenerationTerminalSettlementController` and finalization executors | Identified terminal Room effects and two-barrier settlement integration. | Admission, context assembly, or action presentation. |
| `ConversationRegenerationService` | Resolve one global generation boundary, revalidate it under the normal lock, and request a fresh ordinary generation branch. | Custom grouping, suffix-wide deletion, or context construction. |
| `ConversationCompactController` | Adapt Compact model/config/system prompt/tool disablement, message identity/UI target, retained-summary text projection, and call the ordinary launcher. | A Provider runner, state machine, old-Run restart, custom context path, or custom queue lifecycle. |
| `ContextCompactor` | Threshold/retention calculations and pure Compact text formatting helpers only. | Provider transport, streaming, settlement, Run ownership, or graph mutation. |
| `ChatContextCompactDao` through the sole `ChatDao` | Atomic same-row fresh-Run substitution and target-only Compact deletion/necessary rewiring. | Context semantics, UI boundaries, Provider decisions, or broad graph reconstruction. |
| queue guidance state + `queueMutationMutex` | FIFO ownership, claim revision, exact front requeue, and linearized queue-versus-loop admission. | Holding locks during Provider/network work or attaching guidance to an old Run. |

Room remains the durable source of truth. The streaming overlay is a temporary projection of one
durable message identity and cannot become a parallel message graph.

## 8. Binding module behavior

### 8.1 Ordinary Send and queue drain

- One accepted Send creates one fresh Run, durable USER input, and MODEL placeholder atomically.
- One claimed FIFO drain enters the same Send transaction and creates a fresh Run.
- Input queued while another generation owns the slot stays memory-owned until a legal boundary.
- Claim failure returns the exact batch to the front; durable success transfers ownership exactly
  once. No item may be lost, duplicated, reordered, or attached to the terminal origin Run.
- Normal completion and Stop settlement emit one shared process queue-drain signal. UI owner
  detachment/rebinding may hand that signal off, but it cannot replace it with a Stop-only callback
  or discard a pending FIFO batch.

### 8.2 Regenerate

- Locate scope only through `MessageGenerationBoundaryResolver`.
- Revalidate the visible boundary against the durable graph while serialized.
- The selected boundary's terminal ordinary assistant is the target; an adjacent different Run is
  outside scope.
- Ordinary Regenerate creates a fresh Run and branch using the boundary's real USER source, or the
  first assistant's parent when no real USER is present.
- It must not use the generation boundary to assemble Provider context. The ordinary API-path
  builder does that from the new request parent.

### 8.3 Recompact

- Recompact is ordinary same-position regeneration with a Compact output target.
- It creates a fresh Run and never reactivates the target's terminal Run.
- The target message ID and parent stay fixed. Only the target row's generation-owned fields,
  including its fresh Run identity, may change.
- No new message branch or selected-message edge is created. Every suffix/descendant message row,
  order, parent, content, status, model, and Run identity remains unchanged.
- The old independently owned Compact Run is substituted atomically in the Run graph; failure rolls
  the whole replacement back.

### 8.4 Compact deletion

- Delete exactly the selected Compact row.
- Reparent only direct message children to the deleted row's former parent.
- Preserve every other message field and never delete a suffix subtree.
- Repair only selections and dedicated Run ancestry necessary to keep surviving graphs valid.
- Surviving messages are still grouped by the global Run contract; deletion cannot merge Runs.

### 8.5 Tool-result continuation priority

After a durable tool result:

1. evaluate and run automatic Compact;
2. require that exact Compact message to settle durably with `MessageStatus.SUCCESS`;
3. drain pending or already-claimed FIFO user guidance;
4. admit the no-input loop only if neither exists.

The final queue check and loop admission are one linearized decision. Compact settlement cannot
clear the queue before this decision. ERROR, STOPPED, cancellation, setup/launch failure, missing
message/status, stale identity, or any other Compact anomaly stops this automatic chain. Pending or
claimed guidance remains owned and ordered but is not automatically invoked or cleared after that
failure; only a later explicit user action may resume ordinary queue admission.

### 8.6 Compact UI

Compact may own a capsule renderer, message label/menu, haptic exclusion, and stable presentation.
Its outer row height/padding and internal icon/text/action slots must remain stable across
SENDING/THINKING/terminal/error transitions. UI specialization cannot redefine generation or
context contracts.

When the Compact detail Bottom Sheet is open and the ordinary durable message is
SENDING/answering with no real Markdown output, it shows exactly `Context compacting...` in the
Material primary color. The placeholder enters and leaves with fade animations. Its shared
empty-stream rendering receives an 8 dp internal top inset so the status line does not crowd the
Bottom Sheet divider. As soon as real output exists, the placeholder fades out and the body renders
normally.

A terminal Compact error remains visible in both locations:

- the detail Bottom Sheet places the shared ordinary generation error bar beside the Markdown body;
- the capsule animates to the same theme-derived error palette as the shared error bar without
  changing its bounds and shows an error icon plus exactly `Compact error`. Its container uses the
  error bar's `errorContainer` alpha, its icon uses `error`, and its text uses the error bar's
  alpha-adjusted `error`; saturated hard-coded red or a different error token is forbidden.

A stopped Compact is a non-error terminal presentation. Its capsule keeps the same stable bounds,
shows a stopped icon plus exactly `Compact stopped`, and emits no Snackbar. A failed Compact may
emit only the persisted ordinary generation error segment; generated answer/summary text is never
an error channel. Missing error detail uses a fixed short fallback.

Both presentations derive from the ordinary durable message status/error fields. They do not own a
Compact state machine or infer failure from missing text.

### 8.7 Shared streaming Markdown UI

Ordinary answer Markdown, Thinking Bottom Sheet Markdown, and Compact Bottom Sheet Markdown use one
shared streaming Markdown message UI implementation. That implementation owns the existing
incremental append-only scan, stable/live block split, off-main parsing, long-document update
cadence, and stream-to-terminal renderer continuity. A caller must not keep a second streaming
Markdown algorithm or switch to a different terminal renderer merely because streaming ended.

The implementation is only a parameterized UI variant. Its allowed inputs include Markdown
content, streaming state, render context, font/size/color, and a generic animated empty-stream
presentation. Every live Markdown variant uses the same bounded, position-based trailing-glyph fade;
a caller must not disable that fade merely to hide a surrounding answering-tail dot. The ordinary
message list may own that separate dot, while Thinking and Compact Bottom Sheets omit it without
changing Markdown rendering. Typography or placeholder differences must remain parameterized.

The red generation error bar is not Markdown syntax or renderer state. It is one stateless shared UI
component, not a domain/state object. The ordinary answer body and detail Bottom Sheets render this
same component beside the shared Markdown implementation, driven by the existing error value. It
must not subscribe to, translate, or own generation lifecycle state.

### 8.8 Empty output and automatic handoff

Provider completion with no answer, thought, follow-up, guidance, or other successful output is an
ordinary generation error. Terminal persistence must include a nonblank error value so every
consumer can render the shared error bar.

Every Compact Run success-gates all automatic handoff, not only the no-input loop and regardless of
whether the caller is foreground UI, Task, or Loop. Its ordinary launcher installs the queue-release
suppression before the generation Job can start. Durable
SUCCESS removes exactly that Run's suppression before settlement, allowing the ordinary queue
release and then the existing queue-before-loop decision. ERROR, STOPPED, cancellation, missing or
still-active status, setup failure, launch failure, stale identity, and exceptions leave the
suppression in place; settlement consumes it without starting another Provider request.

Consecutive origin-Run and Compact-Run suppressions are counted. A single boolean is invalid because
the origin release and very fast Compact completion can settle in either order and would otherwise
consume each other's decision. Failure never clears, drops, duplicates, or reorders queued user
input; it leaves that input pending for a later explicit user action.

### 8.9 Provider-hosted output and OpenAI-compatible controls

An official OpenAI Provider or a custom Provider selected as OpenAI-compatible, together with
Responses API enabled, is sufficient to expose both `OpenAI Search` and `Service Tier` in the
conversation UI. No model-name allowlist, capability-discovery request, local capability registry,
or extra relay declaration may suppress those controls. This is a positive availability rule; it
does not redefine any separately supported Service Tier surface outside Responses.

The immutable generation snapshot freezes both choices. When OpenAI Search is enabled, the existing
OpenAI-compatible Responses request includes the native `web_search` tool. When Service Tier is
enabled, that same request includes the normalized selected `service_tier` value. The ordinary
Provider owns request serialization; UI visibility must not create a second request path.

OpenAI Responses reasoning summaries are public summary content, not raw chain-of-thought. When
thinking is enabled on an official or custom OpenAI-compatible Responses transport, the request opts
into the most detailed available summary with `reasoning.summary = auto`. Summary text deltas enter
the ordinary `ThoughtChunk` path and therefore form normal durable thinking segments and thinking
blocks. Deltas with the same `output_index` and `summary_index` remain contiguous; a change in either
index inserts exactly one blank line between summary parts. Bold text or a Markdown heading in the
current summary part supplies the thinking-card title with its marker removed, matching Gemini.
Disabling thinking suppresses both the summary request and its presentation.

Provider-hosted tools use display-only stream events. They may create and settle ordinary tool
segments, but they cannot authorize local execution, enter the tool-effect reducer, or fabricate a
tool-result continuation round. Provider semantic termination still owns whether the request
succeeded; Stop and errors use the shared generation settlement.
A message card with tool segments but no real `thought` segment displays only `Called x tools`.
Message-level thought duration is a fallback only when at least one thought segment exists; it must
not turn a tool-only card into `Thought for xs, called x tools`.
Gemini keeps its hosted output protocol-local. Candidate `groundingMetadata` becomes a completed
`google_search` hosted block displayed as `Google Search`, with normalized `results` for the shared
search presentation and the full grounding metadata retained in the durable result. An
`executableCode` part starts a `code_execution` block displayed as `Code Execution`; the matching
`codeExecutionResult` completes that same block. Code and output are not duplicated into answer
text. Persisted Code Execution segments replay to later Gemini requests as typed executable-code and
code-execution-result model parts in their original order. Multiple pairs remain ordered, and an
unmatched executable-code part leaves a tool in flight so semantic termination fails closed.

If the official service, selected model, or compatible relay rejects `web_search`,
`service_tier`, reasoning summary, or the Responses request itself, that failure is an ordinary
generation error. Persist the provider's bounded error text and render it through the existing red
error bar. Do not silently retry without the parameter, fall back to Chat Completions or generic Web
Search, auto-disable a setting, show the generated response as an error, or use a Snackbar-only or
parallel error presentation.

### 8.10 Provider reuse and mandatory minimum-abstraction rule

Official endpoints and compatible relays reuse the existing Provider implementation selected by the
wire protocol. A relay carrying Claude or Gemini models through an OpenAI-compatible wire contract
uses the OpenAI path; model branding must not select a second lifecycle or an Anthropic/Gemini
transport. Endpoint, authentication, and proven compatibility differences should remain constructor
parameters, existing configuration fields, or narrow overrides whenever those mechanisms are
sufficient.

Provider work must not create a general object model merely to make OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini
look structurally identical. Their request encoding, authentication, stream state machine,
signature/history replay, and terminal proof may remain direct protocol-local code. Reuse is
required at the existing generation lifecycle, semantic `StreamEvent`, message/tool projection, and
proven shared utility boundaries; wire-level uniformity is not a goal.

The following are binding review blockers:

- Do not add `ProviderDescriptor`, `ProviderCapabilities`, transport/policy/strategy objects,
  adapter layers, wrapper configs, factories, or interfaces by default. A proposed name or diagram
  is not evidence that an abstraction is needed.
- Do not move existing booleans or fields into a new data object merely to make the configuration
  appear cleaner. One owner and one consumer should normally remain a direct field, parameter, or
  protocol-local condition.
- A new object or interface is allowed only when the task record and review identify a cohesive
  invariant it owns, a real external/transactional side-effect boundary it isolates, or multiple
  genuine stable consumers. They must also state why the existing owner plus parameters is unsafe or
  insufficient and which existing responsibility or duplication will be removed.
- A refactor that only adds indirection, pass-through calls, mirrored types, mapping layers, or
  speculative extension points is invalid. Net object growth requires an explicit reduction in
  ownership ambiguity, duplicated behavior, or failure surface.
- Capability handling should stay as the smallest direct check in the owning Provider/configuration
  path until several real features need the exact same rule. Unknown relay behavior fails closed;
  that alone does not justify a capability framework.

## 9. Context assembly contract in module terms

`GenerationApiPathBuilder` receives one immutable durable snapshot and a requested parent ID. It
walks only that parent chain, stops at the first successful Compact encountered upward, expands
protocol side chains without duplication, and projects Room entities once. The shared immediate
pre-Provider projection then applies image/user-template transforms and appends an optional frozen
API-only initial USER prompt. For Compact that prompt is mandatory and therefore the final request
item is USER even when the durable parent is Assistant; ordinary requests without such a configured
prompt remain unchanged.

The API-only USER prompt is counted as fixed request cost so threshold and rollout accounting cannot
omit bytes that dispatch sends. It is appended only to the initial Provider request and is not part
of retained-message calculation, Room history, generation-boundary grouping, or later tool rounds.

A Compact preflight may call this read-only ordinary builder to calculate retained-summary text.
That projection is not authoritative input for execution and cannot replace or suppress the
ordinary Provider request rebuild inside the shared generation tail.

A branch-selection change, missing parent, or corrupt chain must fail closed or produce only the
reachable safe prefix. It must never jump to a Compact on another branch.

## 10. Concurrency and failure-safety principles

1. **Single process authority.** Only the conversation mailbox/reducer accepts lifecycle
   transitions. Controllers execute accepted effects; they do not maintain shadow state.
2. **One durable live Run.** The Room active-slot constraint and transactional preconditions are
   mandatory. A fresh Run is inserted only when no other live Run exists.
3. **Fresh identity per admission.** Run IDs are generated before the durable transaction and never
   reused to restart terminal work.
4. **Identity fencing.** Asynchronous Provider, tool, checkpoint, Stop, and finalization results are
   accepted only for the expected conversation, owner token, Run, pass, and effect ID.
5. **Durable-before-external.** Provider execution begins only after the Run/message graph commits
   and the process state binds that exact Run.
6. **Terminal-before-handoff.** Compact, queue, or loop continuation starts only after the origin
   Run's legal terminal boundary. Checkpoint writers close before terminal persistence.
7. **Short lock scope.** Queue mutexes and graph/selection locks protect only decisions and
   transactions; never hold them across Provider streams, tool execution, or UI waits.
8. **Revalidation.** UI-derived targets, parent links, terminal status, Run ownership, and selected
   edges are re-read inside the serialized/transactional boundary.
9. **Atomic replacement.** Same-row fresh-Run substitution either updates the target and Run graph
   completely or changes nothing. Non-target message rows are immutable inputs.
10. **Cancellation robustness.** Cancellation cannot strand a SENDING row, lose a claimed queue
    lease, reopen a terminal Run, or bypass both coroutine and durable settlement barriers. A Stop
    persistence failure keeps the slot occupied; only after that exact failure is recorded may a
    later Stop reissue the same finalization effect identity. Concurrent duplicates and stale
    identities remain rejected. If cancellation or failure is delivered at a suspending Run-graph
    commit boundary, the owner must re-read the exact proposed Run before treating the transaction
    as uncommitted or allowing the process slot to release.
11. **Bounded persistence.** Final transforms may change only declared presentation text and the
    shared persistence guard is reapplied afterward.
12. **Fail closed.** Missing/cyclic parents, shared legacy Runs that cannot be substituted safely,
    selection drift, stale identity, and partial transaction results reject the operation rather
    than guessing or broadening mutation scope.

## 11. Abstraction and growth principles

- Prefer an existing ordinary owner over a new feature layer. Configuration data and target
  parameters are preferred to another controller/state machine.
- Keep a rule pure when it is pure. Boundary and presentation policies should be deterministic
  functions with focused tests.
- Extract a module only when it owns a cohesive invariant, a real external/transactional side
  effect boundary, or multiple genuine consumers. Do not create pass-through wrappers, type
  aliases, one-call factories, or speculative interfaces.
- Conversely, do not let a simple owner grow into unrelated responsibilities. If a file starts
  mixing admission, context, Provider execution, persistence, and UI policy, split along the
  ownership table above rather than by arbitrary line count.
- Durable fields such as `parentId`, `runId`, status, and selected edges drive generic policy.
  Message prefixes may identify presentation/protocol types but must not create parallel lifecycle
  semantics.
- Compatibility handling belongs at the narrow read/transaction boundary and must not pollute the
  normal path. New writes obey current contracts; unsafe legacy states fail closed.
- Comments explain ownership and invariants, not a second algorithm. Tests assert observable
  contracts, not source spelling.
- No architecture claim is complete until focused concurrency/failure tests, both flavor unit
  suites, the project source-size/architecture gates, and the required build succeed.

## 12. Required verification ownership

| Contract | Minimum focused proof |
|---|---|
| Generation grouping | Real USER hard boundaries; same-Run protocol/assistant rows remain one group; every Run transition separates groups; blank legacy IDs are safe. |
| Action/status projection | Every real USER has actions; only each Run group's terminal ordinary assistant has assistant actions/status; different Runs remain separate. |
| Fresh-Run admission | Send, queue drain, Compact, Recompact, and Regenerate never restart a terminal Run. |
| Context boundary | Parent-chain nearest successful Compact wins; closer ERROR/STOPPED/SENDING Compact is ignored; off-branch Compact is unreachable. |
| Recompact isolation | Same message ID/parent, fresh Run, unchanged selections and byte-for-byte unchanged non-target message rows/suffix. |
| Delete isolation | Target-only delete, direct-child reparent, unchanged surviving rows, independent Run presentation. |
| Priority | Only Compact SUCCESS permits handoff; then pending and already-claimed queue guidance beat loop and the no-guidance path admits loop once. ERROR/STOPPED/cancellation/anomaly starts neither. |
| Request terminal role | Compact dispatch appends one non-durable initial USER invocation after an Assistant or tool-result parent; provider-visible input ends USER and fixed token accounting includes it. |
| Provider-hosted output | OpenAI-compatible Responses requests serialize enabled `web_search`, selected `service_tier`, and reasoning summaries; summary indices preserve part boundaries and headings supply titles; OpenAI Search and Gemini Google Search/Code Execution settle display-only tool blocks without local execution; Gemini Code Execution replays typed parts and fails closed when a result is missing. |
| Races and failures | Stop before/after bind, consecutive origin/Compact release suppressions in both settlement orders, selection drift, missing target/status, transaction rollback, stale callbacks, checkpoint-versus-terminal ordering, and queue claim failure. |
| UI stability | Compact row/pill vertical bounds do not change across progress and terminal content; entrance is draw-only and does not alter apparent vertical spacing; error colors match the shared error bar theme tokens and alpha. |
