# Message Generation Architecture Contract

Status: authoritative development contract, 2026-08-13.

This document is required context for every Agora development task. It defines two global and
orthogonal message contracts. Features such as Compact consume these contracts; they must not
create parallel feature-specific definitions.

All software behavior must conform to these contracts, including normal execution, concurrency,
Room transactions, UI projection, errors, Stop/cancellation, recovery, automation, tools, queue
handoff, and legacy compatibility. Conflicting old code, tests, or documentation must be corrected;
they do not authorize a feature-local exception or parallel contract.

Implementation should reuse the existing ordinary pipeline, concepts, state owners, and objects to
the greatest practical extent. Robustness is the primary design objective: contract correctness,
identity fencing, failure atomicity, deterministic recovery, and cancellation safety outrank
cosmetic abstraction. Add an abstraction only for a cohesive invariant, a real side-effect
boundary, or multiple genuine consumers.

## 1. Terms and strict separation

A **generation boundary** identifies the visible messages produced by one generation. It is used
only to locate Regenerate scope and to decide ownership of per-generation status and bottom action
controls.

A **context boundary** identifies the oldest message included in one Provider request. It is used
only by ordinary context/API-path assembly.

The generation-boundary resolver must never select, truncate, reorder, or assemble Provider
context. The context assembler must never infer UI action ownership or Regenerate range.

## 2. Global generation-boundary contract

1. Every real USER message starts a generation boundary, regardless of neighboring message types
   or legacy Run identity.
2. All messages produced inside one generation share one nonblank `runId`. A Run is one indivisible
   generation group; no boundary may be created inside it.
3. A change to a different nonblank `runId` starts a new generation group. Protocol rows,
   Compact rows, and ordinary assistant rows all participate in this Run grouping.
4. Every actual send/generation admission creates a fresh Run ID. It must never reactivate an old
   Run. This includes the Send button, one claimed FIFO queue drain, automatic/manual Compact,
   Recompact, and Regenerate. Provider passes and tool rounds that continue the same admitted
   generation remain inside that generation's Run.
5. Blank legacy Run IDs do not authorize destructive guessing. A real USER remains a hard boundary;
   new writes must always use a nonblank fresh Run ID.

`MessageGenerationBoundaryResolver` is the shared owner of this definition. Compact, Delete,
Recompact, Regenerate, rendering, and status presentation may consume it but may not add local
boundary exceptions.

## 3. UI and Regenerate consequences

- Every real USER message always owns its bottom action controls.
- One Run group owns one generation status presentation.
- The last ordinary assistant output in a Run group owns that group's assistant action controls.
- Adjacent assistants from different Runs remain independently actionable even when an intervening
  Compact is deleted.
- Ordinary Regenerate targets only the selected generation group, creates a fresh Run, and does not
  absorb an adjacent Run.
- Same-position replacement is an output-target option, not a new generation contract. Recompact
  creates a fresh Run and replaces only the selected Compact row at its existing message ID and
  parent. It must not create a branch, clear suffix messages, rewrite descendants, or mutate any
  other message.
- Deleting a Compact deletes only that row and reparents only its direct message children to the
  deleted row's former parent. It must not merge surviving generation groups.

## 4. Global context-boundary contract

For every ordinary Provider request:

1. Start at the request's latest selected parent message.
2. Walk upward through the durable `parentId` chain.
3. The nearest Compact on that chain whose generation ended normally and without error
   (`MessageStatus.SUCCESS`) is the context boundary.
4. That successful Compact is the topmost context message. Older ancestors are excluded.
5. Failed, stopped, in-flight, missing, or off-branch Compact rows are not context boundaries.
6. If no successful Compact exists on the selected ancestor chain, context continues to the oldest
   reachable ancestor.
7. Provider projection may convert the successful Compact capsule into the established summary
   input role, but it must preserve the boundary position and following message order.

`GenerationApiPathBuilder` and the ordinary Provider message projection own this contract.
Manual/automatic Compact and Recompact use this same ordinary path from their requested graph
position. `MessageGenerationBoundaryResolver` has no role here.

## 5. Shared generation lifecycle

Compact is an ordinary generation with only the declared minimal differences: message identity and
UI, haptic exclusion, selected model and generation parameters, tools disabled, Compact system
prompt, and one frozen API-only Compact invocation. It reuses ordinary admission, fresh Run
creation, context/API-path assembly, Provider execution, streaming/checkpoints, Stop/cancellation,
terminal settlement, recovery, and queue release.

The Compact invocation is appended by the shared pre-Provider request projection as the final USER
message. It is request-only configuration: it participates in exact token accounting but is never
written to Room, rendered as a visible message, assigned a Run boundary, or used to alter durable
parentage. The configured Compact summary instructions remain the system prompt; the final USER
turn only invokes that behavior. This guarantees a valid terminal input role even when the durable
Compact parent is an Assistant message.

After a durable tool result and a successful Compact, continuation priority is:

`Compact SUCCESS -> FIFO queued user message -> loop`

The queue claim/check and loop admission must remain linearized so guidance is neither duplicated
nor lost. A non-successful or anomalous Compact is a hard automatic-handoff boundary: it starts
neither queued generation nor loop generation.

## 6. Review blockers

A change is invalid if it:

- uses generation boundaries to assemble Provider context;
- uses context boundaries to merge UI generations or choose Regenerate scope;
- reuses or reactivates a terminal Run for a new send/generation;
- adds a Compact-specific boundary or generation lifecycle;
- adds a Provider descriptor, capabilities/policy object, adapter layer, wrapper, interface, or
  factory without a demonstrated cohesive invariant, real side-effect boundary, or multiple
  genuine stable consumers and without removing an existing responsibility or duplication;
- mutates suffix/neighbor messages during same-position replacement;
- merges actions or status across different Run IDs;
- treats a non-successful Compact as a context boundary.

Focused tests must cover each rule, including legacy blank IDs, protocol rows, failed/stopped
Compact rows, nearest-successful-ancestor selection, fresh-Run Recompact, suffix isolation, and
concurrent queue-versus-loop admission.

## 7. Module boundaries and responsibilities

| Module | Owns | Must not own |
|---|---|---|
| `ChatMessage`, `RunEntity`, status/identity models | Durable vocabulary and small identity predicates. | UI grouping, context walks, orchestration, or side effects. |
| `MessageGenerationBoundaryResolver` | Pure visible-range grouping for one generation by real USER and Run identity. | Context assembly, graph writes, branch mutation, Provider payloads, or Compact-specific rules. |
| `RunUiProjection` | Pure action/status/branch-control presentation derived from generation boundaries. | Generation admission, context selection, or database mutation. |
| `ConversationRuntimeReducer` + `ConversationGenerationState` + mailbox | The single in-process authority for one conversation's slot, accepted effects, Stop barriers, and stale-result rejection. | Provider protocol parsing, Room transaction bodies, or feature-specific context logic. |
| `ConversationExecutionCoordinator` | Per-conversation execution serialization around admitted work. | A second Run state, queue ownership, or result acceptance. |
| `GenerationRequestBuilder` | One immutable admission snapshot: selected model, Provider registry, generation parameters, tools/memory/attachment policy. | Provider execution or live settings reads after admission. |
| `GenerationApiPathBuilder` | Read-only durable parent-chain walk, nearest-successful-Compact context boundary, Provider message projection input, and fixed Provider config. | UI generation boundaries, Run creation, queue policy, or writes. |
| `StandardGenerationContinuationLauncher` | The ordinary fresh-Run graph transaction for a continuation and the optional same-row output target. | A Compact lifecycle, Provider implementation, context reconstruction, or old-Run restart. |
| `BoundRunGenerationLauncher` | Binding one already-created fresh Run to the shared generation tail and identified callbacks. | Run graph creation, boundary inference, or terminal writes outside shared settlement. |
| `GenerationManager` | Mailbox-authorized Provider/tool execution, streaming overlay/checkpoints, generic bounded final text projection, and terminal-effect request. | Branch selection, UI grouping, Compact policy, queue reordering, or independent lifecycle state. |
| `GenerationTerminalSettlementController` and finalization executors | Identified terminal Room effects and two-barrier settlement integration. | Admission, context assembly, or action presentation. |
| `ConversationRegenerationService` | Resolve one global generation boundary, revalidate it under the normal lock, and request a fresh ordinary generation branch. | Custom grouping, suffix-wide deletion, or context construction. |
| `ConversationCompactController` | Adapt Compact model/config/system prompt/tool disablement, message identity/UI target, retained-summary text projection, and call the ordinary launcher. | A Provider runner, state machine, old-Run restart, custom context path, or custom queue lifecycle. |
| `ContextCompactor` | Threshold/retention calculations and pure Compact text formatting helpers only. | Provider transport, streaming, settlement, Run ownership, or graph mutation. |
| `ChatContextCompactDao` through the sole `ChatDao` | Atomic same-row fresh-Run substitution and target-only Compact deletion/necessary rewiring. | Context semantics, UI boundaries, Provider decisions, or broad graph reconstruction. |
| queue guidance state + `queueMutationMutex` | FIFO ownership, claim revision, exact front requeue, and linearized queue-versus-loop admission. | Holding locks during Provider/network work or attaching guidance to an old Run. |

Room remains the durable source of truth. The streaming overlay is a temporary projection of one
durable message identity and cannot become a parallel message graph.

## 8. Binding module behavior

### 8.1 Ordinary Send and queue drain

- One accepted Send creates one fresh Run, durable USER input, and MODEL placeholder atomically.
- One claimed FIFO drain enters the same Send transaction and creates a fresh Run.
- Input queued while another generation owns the slot stays memory-owned until a legal boundary.
- Claim failure returns the exact batch to the front; durable success transfers ownership exactly
  once. No item may be lost, duplicated, reordered, or attached to the terminal origin Run.
- Normal completion and Stop settlement emit one shared process queue-drain signal. UI owner
  detachment/rebinding may hand that signal off, but it cannot replace it with a Stop-only callback
  or discard a pending FIFO batch.

### 8.2 Regenerate

- Locate scope only through `MessageGenerationBoundaryResolver`.
- Revalidate the visible boundary against the durable graph while serialized.
- The selected boundary's terminal ordinary assistant is the target; an adjacent different Run is
  outside scope.
- Ordinary Regenerate creates a fresh Run and branch using the boundary's real USER source, or the
  first assistant's parent when no real USER is present.
- It must not use the generation boundary to assemble Provider context. The ordinary API-path
  builder does that from the new request parent.

### 8.3 Recompact

- Recompact is ordinary same-position regeneration with a Compact output target.
- It creates a fresh Run and never reactivates the target's terminal Run.
- The target message ID and parent stay fixed. Only the target row's generation-owned fields,
  including its fresh Run identity, may change.
- No new message branch or selected-message edge is created. Every suffix/descendant message row,
  order, parent, content, status, model, and Run identity remains unchanged.
- The old independently owned Compact Run is substituted atomically in the Run graph; failure rolls
  the whole replacement back.

### 8.4 Compact deletion

- Delete exactly the selected Compact row.
- Reparent only direct message children to the deleted row's former parent.
- Preserve every other message field and never delete a suffix subtree.
- Repair only selections and dedicated Run ancestry necessary to keep surviving graphs valid.
- Surviving messages are still grouped by the global Run contract; deletion cannot merge Runs.

For ordinary structural message-branch deletion, selected-message and selected-Run repair use the
same sibling order. If the selected branch is deleted, choose the immediate surviving later sibling
first, fall back to the immediate surviving earlier sibling only when no later sibling exists, and
remove the selection when neither exists. Message and Run selections must not diverge. This ordering
rule does not broaden the deleted subtree, change synthetic-row filtering, or move transaction/file
cleanup ownership.

### 8.5 Tool-result continuation priority

After a durable tool result:

1. evaluate and run automatic Compact;
2. require that exact Compact message to settle durably with `MessageStatus.SUCCESS`;
3. drain pending or already-claimed FIFO user guidance;
4. admit the no-input loop only if neither exists.

The final queue check and loop admission are one linearized decision. Compact settlement cannot
clear the queue before this decision. ERROR, STOPPED, cancellation, setup/launch failure, missing
message/status, stale identity, or any other Compact anomaly stops this automatic chain. Pending or
claimed guidance remains owned and ordered but is not automatically invoked or cleared after that
failure; only a later explicit user action may resume ordinary queue admission.

### 8.6 Compact UI

Compact may own a capsule renderer, message label/menu, haptic exclusion, and stable presentation.
Its outer row height/padding and internal icon/text/action slots must remain stable across
SENDING/THINKING/terminal/error transitions. The capsule Row uses a 14 dp start inset and a tighter
7 dp end inset so the 32 dp overflow-action touch target remains visually balanced; its 18 dp icon,
leading spacing, minimum height, menu behavior, and action enablement remain unchanged. UI
specialization cannot redefine generation or context contracts.

When the Compact detail Bottom Sheet is open and the ordinary durable message is
SENDING/answering with no real Markdown output, it shows the localized equivalent of
`Context compacting...` in the Material primary color. The placeholder enters and leaves with fade animations. Its shared
empty-stream rendering receives an 8 dp internal top inset so the status line does not crowd the
Bottom Sheet divider. As soon as real output exists, the placeholder fades out and the body renders
normally.

A terminal Compact error remains visible in both locations:

- the detail Bottom Sheet places the shared neutral-gray generation error bar beside the Markdown
  body;
- the capsule retains its existing theme-derived error palette independently of the neutral terminal
  bar, without changing its bounds, and shows an error icon plus the localized equivalent of
  `Compact error`. Its container uses `errorContainer`, its icon uses `error`, and its text uses alpha-adjusted
  `error`; saturated hard-coded red or a different error token is forbidden.

A stopped Compact is a non-error terminal presentation. Its capsule keeps the same stable bounds,
shows a stopped icon plus the localized equivalent of `Compact stopped`, and emits no Snackbar. A
failed Compact may emit only the persisted ordinary generation error segment; generated answer/summary text is never
an error channel. Missing error detail uses a localized short fallback.

All app-owned Compact settings, delete/recompact actions, boundary messages, streaming/status chrome,
and known preflight/launch failure reasons must resolve through Android resources in the current
locale. Domain owners carry a semantic `CompactFailureReason`, an optional nonblank external detail,
and the affected message identity; they do not manufacture user-facing English. One narrow
presentation resolver is shared by the manual and automatic UI consumers. Nonblank Provider or
persisted error detail remains verbatim diagnostic content and is never translated. Internal
invariant/debug exceptions are not user-visible resources.

Both terminal presentations derive from the ordinary durable message status/error fields. They do
not own a Compact state machine or infer failure from missing text.

### 8.7 Shared streaming Markdown UI

Ordinary answer Markdown, Thinking Bottom Sheet Markdown, and Compact Bottom Sheet Markdown use one
shared streaming Markdown message UI implementation. That implementation owns the existing
incremental append-only scan, stable/live block split, off-main parsing, long-document update
cadence, and stream-to-terminal renderer continuity. A caller must not keep a second streaming
Markdown algorithm or switch to a different terminal renderer merely because streaming ended.

The implementation is only a parameterized UI variant. Its allowed inputs include Markdown
content, streaming state, render context, font/size/color, and a generic animated empty-stream
presentation. Every live Markdown variant uses the same bounded, position-based trailing-glyph fade;
a caller must not disable that fade merely to hide a surrounding answering-tail dot. The ordinary
message list may own that separate dot, while Thinking and Compact Bottom Sheets omit it without
changing Markdown rendering. Typography or placeholder differences must remain parameterized.

Finalized Thinking Bottom Sheet Markdown is selectable in every rendering branch, including the
virtualized single-segment long-document path. Selection uses the shared no-auto-scroll selection
host so dragging handles never repositions the conversation. Active streaming content remains
non-selectable; once that same renderer reaches terminal state, selection is enabled without
switching Markdown implementations or disabling virtualization.

Generation terminal presentation is not Markdown syntax or renderer state. One stateless shared text
component renders the ordinary answer and detail-sheet error beside the shared Markdown
implementation. It does not subscribe to or own generation lifecycle state.

Typed `GenerationError` remains the domain boundary. Before chat generation or transcription
persists a display error, one Android-resource-backed presenter resolves app-owned categories and
known transport reasons in the current locale. Authentication, rate limit, server/network wrappers,
SSE parse, incomplete stream, output truncation, request validation, cancellation, timeout,
unexpected-error fallback, and tool/transcription/embedding wrappers are resource owned in every
supported locale. Exact common transport details such as connection closed/refused/reset, unknown
host, and TLS failure are matched case-insensitively and localized. Nonblank Provider/API/server/OS
diagnostic detail remains verbatim inside the localized wrapper unless it is plain prose whose first
lowercase Unicode letter can be title-cased safely; codes, URLs, JSON, and identifiers are not
rewritten. A narrow render-time compatibility normalizer applies the same known-phrase and safe
sentence-case rules to already-persisted strings without mutating Room data. For display only, a
JSON object may contribute one nonblank human-readable detail in the strict order nested
`error.message`, top-level `message`, then top-level `reason`; JSON escapes are decoded and
duplicate envelope fields are omitted. Malformed JSON, non-object JSON, or an object without one of
those supported string fields remains verbatim. This display extraction never changes persisted or
Provider-facing text.

A normal durable MODEL row ending in ERROR or STOPPED remains that exact assistant turn in every
later Provider request. API-only canonicalization preserves its nonblank partial answer first and
appends one terminal annotation to the same assistant text. ERROR then appends the exact last
nonblank persisted `error` segment, without localization, JSON extraction, sentence casing,
truncation, or other rewriting; only legacy error-only rows without an error segment may use their
stored text as the detail. STOPPED appends its stopped annotation even when no partial answer exists.
The API projection normalizes only its transient status to prevent duplicate projection; it never
changes Room. It must not change either terminal row to USER, prepend it to a later user message, or
drop the concrete error. Synthetic tool/result rows and Compact rows retain their dedicated
protocol and terminal contracts.

Ordinary assistant messages render no general-purpose status row. Sending, Thinking, answering,
terminal success/token usage, stopped, and failed labels must not restore that variable-height legacy
row. Its historical position above all Thinking/tool/answer content instead retains exactly one empty,
status-independent 8 dp vertical spacer. This is a fixed height, not a minimum-height threshold, and it
never hosts or alters the current below-Thinking pre-output/Retry activity.
Generation ERROR and STOPPED render text only: no Surface/background, rounded outline, Info icon,
icon gap, or inner container padding. Both use the exact Retry label tokens, `ChatType.body` and
`onSurfaceVariant` at 0.55 alpha, but neither uses Retry's grapheme entrance or active white dot.
ERROR remains full-line, multiline, and selectable with its nonblank detail; STOPPED remains a
localized content-width label. Their existing contextual outer vertical separation remains, and
their durable ERROR versus STOPPED semantics stay distinct. Compact capsule error/stopped chrome is
independent and unchanged.

Generation activity uses one direct, layout-owned white dot at the currently active slot.
No transparent source marker, visual clone, source registry, coordinate follower, match-parent overlay,
or dot-specific z layer participates. The pre-output and Retry slot remains after visible
Thought/Tool/Transcription presentation and before answer Markdown; the answer-tail slot remains
after answer content. Their existing visibility predicates are mutually exclusive, so only the
active slot draws the shared dot.

Pre-output keeps the exact 11 dp dot. A no-Answer transition to visible
Thought/Tool/Transcription content or terminal disappearance retains the last non-hidden inline mode
through its unchanged 320 ms exit. Visible Answer activation is instead an immediate direct-source
handoff: the pre-output/Retry host releases layout and stops drawing in that frame, and the answer-tail
dot is the only source from its first frame at the final anchor. The outgoing inline Row must never
temporarily inflate message height beneath a newly visible Answer. Retry keeps the localized label,
8 dp gap, measured caret placement, and direct render-layer translation of that same dot. The answer
tail keeps its fixed
anchor height and lift and directly owns its established 400 ms entrance and 320 ms exit fade/scale.
Each direct source owns its own opacity, breathing, size, and lifecycle. Direct activity and tail
exit paths retain their content through zero alpha with explicit transition state; they do not use
`AnimatedVisibility`. Their two alpha-bearing graphics layers use
`CompositingStrategy.ModulateAlpha`, never default `Auto` or `Offscreen`, so exit opacity cannot
rasterize the 1.30x breathing circle into tight rectangular layout bounds. Every graphics layer on
the direct-dot path sets `clip = false`. The dot never uses `animateContentSize`, expand/shrink
layout animation, a halo, inflated bounds, coordinate conversion, Euler integration, or retained
follower velocity. Reduced Motion removes only spatial
scale movement while preserving direct placement and the continuous-motion policy still owns
breathing.

Retry still fades its label in by Unicode grapheme at 27 ms per grapheme, bounded to
225-600 ms, with the fast-start, slow-finish `LinearOutSlowInEasing` curve. The entrance plays only
once for one fresh retry-indicator composition. Attempt/label updates inside that episode show the
complete new label without replaying text entrance. Leaving and later re-entering Retry may create a
fresh label-reveal composition. Reduced Motion shows the complete label immediately; the directly
rendered dot keeps the ordinary continuous-motion breathing policy. The label remains ordinary
Markdown body size and semi-transparent gray, and Retry presentation never owns scrolling or
attachment state.

The compact Thinking card is content-width and left-aligned while collapsed, and fills the available
message width while expanded. Its shell extends exactly 4 dp into both sides of the message list's
8 dp content inset, producing symmetric 4 dp screen-side margins in the expanded state. The collapsed
state retains content width and the same 4 dp left edge. One shared start-anchored horizontal-overflow
host must keep the outer message layout at normal width while measuring the inner card shell with
unbounded horizontal constraints. Merely calculating parent width plus 8 dp and applying preferred
`width` or `requiredWidth` directly under a bounded parent is invalid because coercion/centering can
discard or displace the right extension. This external-only rule must not change header or segment
content padding. It must not use card-level `animateContentSize`: an explicit
400 ms width-only transition matches the existing 400 ms vertical expansion/collapse and animates
between the measured localized header width plus a 12 dp anti-ellipsis allowance and the extended
parent maximum width with a fast-start, slow-finish `LinearOutSlowInEasing` curve. The collapsed
target remains capped by the available width. The animated width belongs only to the card shell:
leading header content and expanded content retain a stable target layout width, remain anchored at
`Alignment.TopStart`, and are clipped/revealed by the shell instead of being squeezed, reflowed, or
centered at intermediate widths. Reduced Motion snaps spatial width.

The header uses an 18 dp corner radius, restored 12 dp start by 10 dp vertical padding, an 18 dp icon
slot, an 8 dp icon-title gap, and the accepted local 13 sp / 22 sp SemiBold title. Expanded Thought
and Tool rows use the restored exact 10 dp horizontal content padding. The title row reserves one
exact 4 dp title-to-arrow gap plus the unchanged 26 dp trailing disclosure reservation. The same single 18 dp
`KeyboardArrowDown` is a Surface-local overlay, outside the unbounded/clipped content Row, so its
layout box tracks the visible animated shell's end edge with an exact 8 dp end inset at every width.
No second disclosure exists. That single vector rotates to -90 degrees for detail-sheet navigation,
0 degrees while inline-collapsed, and 180 degrees while inline-expanded; spatial motion animates the
rotation and Reduced Motion snaps it. The header icon uses the shared motion-aware 18 dp slot; only
the loading ring is 16 dp while brain, tool, image, and disclosure icons remain 18 dp. The loading
ring appears when any Thought, Tool, or Transcription segment in that card is active during the
ordinary message generation. Independently, while that generation is active, the current tail
Thinking card also remains loading when no visible answer exists below it, even after its own
segments have settled. A historical card or a card followed by visible answer content does not gain
loading from message-level generation. Once the owning message/Run is terminal, no persisted segment
state may keep the card header loading: in particular, a detached `BACKGROUND_RUNNING` tool keeps
its own tool-row background status but is terminal for card-level generation presentation.
The indicator uses an exact 2 dp stroke. Loading, brain, tool, and image icon changes all remain
targets of the existing Crossfade; no active/static icon change is abrupt. During an active Thought,
only an absent/default `Thinking...` title becomes a once-per-second localized live-duration label
based on the latest snapshot. Live and terminal duration titles share one three-tier breakdown:
seconds below 60 seconds; minutes plus seconds below one hour; hours plus minutes plus seconds at or
above one hour. Terminal tool-count variants use the same breakdown before their unchanged tool-count
suffix. Provider titles and Tool/Transcription titles remain semantic. At every Provider-pass thought boundary, the runtime finishes
authoritative thought timing and changes the in-memory live status from THINKING to SENDING before
publishing that finished-duration snapshot. The UI ticker and Thought-active loading condition stop
at that timing boundary; current-tail loading may continue while generation remains active until an
answer appears below the card or generation terminalizes. Later terminal settlement must not make
the displayed duration decrease.

Answer Markdown and Thinking-segment Markdown use one presentation multiplier of exactly 1.1 for
line height only. It applies to paragraph/body, ordered and unordered lists, tables, H1-H6,
block/inline code, and both streaming plain-text fallbacks. Answer/Thinking Markdown font sizes and
their source `ChatType` tokens remain unchanged; the multiplier belongs to the chat Markdown asset owner.

User-message body text uses the dedicated `ChatType.userBody` token at 15 sp with an exact 24.2 sp
line height, equal to the former 22 sp line height multiplied by 1.1. Branch navigation, the inline
editor, and dropdown-menu typography are unchanged.

A non-editing user bubble owns its action dropdown through long press. The separate action row below
the bubble is absent; the branch selector remains independently visible. The existing Material menu
style contains Copy, Edit, Select Text, Info, and Delete in that order and retains current availability
rules. Selecting Edit enters that user message's existing inline editor and requests focus on its
TextField once the edit branch is composed, so it is immediately ready for typing. This focus request
does not select text, redefine cursor placement, force the IME through a second owner, or alter
composer/search focus policy. Select Text reuses the existing custom Thinking detail-sheet shell with
title `Select Text` and
renders only the raw user message text in the shared no-auto-scroll native selection host. That
sheet-only body copies `ChatType.userBody` with font size reduced from 15 sp to 14 sp while retaining
the shared exact 24.2 sp line height; the user bubble itself remains 15 sp. Its raw content branch uses
12 dp top, 24 dp horizontal, and 32 dp bottom padding so text does not crowd the header divider. It
does not include attachments.

Thinking, Select Text, and Sources share one reusable `SmoothBottomSheet` Compose shell. A small
stable state plus `rememberSmoothBottomSheetState` owns Hidden/Partial/Expanded values; the shell
owns the edge-to-edge Dialog/Surface, 0/0.45/0.94 anchors, 0.9 damping and 350 stiffness snap spring,
interruption, native dim curve, scrim/back dismissal, draggable handle/header, Reduced Motion snap,
and nested-scroll collapse driven by a caller-provided content-at-top predicate. `SegmentDetailSheet`
owns selected-segment navigation, titles/back action, scroll/LazyList state, Markdown/tool/media,
footer/error, and Select Text content. The Sources caller owns its dynamic title, ordered LazyList,
list-top predicate, and pending source activation; selecting a row requests the shell's normal hide
transition and activates that source only after dismissal completes. Extraction preserves the shared
geometry, thresholds, motion, header/divider, and rendering. Image, settings, and composer sheets
remain owned by `MotionAwareModalBottomSheet` and are not migrated.

Ordinary Timeline mode groups each visually consecutive Thought/Tool/Transcription run with the exact
Settings group grammar: 2 dp between surfaces; a single row uses 24 dp corners; the first uses 24 dp
outer-top and 5 dp adjoining-bottom corners; middle rows use 5 dp corners; the last uses 5 dp
adjoining-top and 24 dp outer-bottom corners. All four radii animate when a streamed row changes an
existing row's group position. Each radius uses one monotonic 240 ms `FastOutSlowInEasing` tween,
never a bouncy/overshooting spring, and is clamped to [5 dp, 24 dp] after animation; Reduced Motion
snaps directly to the clamped target. The existing one-shot 420 ms row fade/scale entrance is
independent and unchanged. Timeline
Thought/Tool/Transcription cards and grouped blocks own exactly one appearance modifier on their
actual overflow-sized Surface; a bounded outer appearance Box and a second 0.90 scale layer are
forbidden because they clip the deliberate 4 dp overflow. Answer-block appearance ownership remains
unchanged.
Group position is resolved from rendered order rather than raw adjacent indices: a nonblank visible
Answer ends the run, while blank Answer, Error, and any other non-rendered segment are transparent to
the previous/next scan. Invalid indices fail closed as a single row. The top/bottom spacing between a
run and surrounding answer content remains unchanged.
Ordinary inline Timeline shells reuse the same start-anchored unbounded host and extend 4 dp into
both sides of the message list's 8 dp inset, matching the expanded Thinking shell's symmetric
4 dp/4 dp outer margins without changing internal padding. They must not rely on bounded-parent
`requiredWidth` overflow. The Thinking segment bottom-sheet list uses the same shapes and 2 dp separation but retains its own
sheet-local 20 dp horizontal inset. The shared Timeline/sheet card row uses 10 dp vertical internal
padding, increasing both presentations without a fixed or minimum height.

The top-level Thinking segment bottom-sheet title uses the same shared semantic/live title resolver as
its compact Thinking card, including default live `Thinking for Ns...`, Provider titles, Tool/
Transcription titles, and terminal duration summaries. A selected detail page retains its own segment
title. Sheet-list segment surfaces use a neutral translucent gray
`surfaceVariant.copy(alpha = 0.25f)` container with unchanged `onSurfaceVariant` text content.
Thought, Tool, and Transcription leading icons use full `primary`; the trailing disclosure arrow
uses neutral gray `onSurfaceVariant` at 0.5 alpha. Inline Timeline and compact Thinking palettes
remain unchanged. The detail-page circular back button alone overrides the shared
`CircularBackButton` container with `surfaceVariant.copy(alpha = 0.25f)`; its foreground and the
global component defaults remain unchanged.

The Thinking segment Card/Bottom Sheet setting is visible and effective only while Tool-call display
mode is Grouped or Compact. Timeline ignores a persisted Bottom Sheet preference and retains ordinary
inline Timeline presentation; the stored value remains untouched and becomes effective again after
switching back to Grouped or Compact. Auto-Expand Active Group is visible and effective only for the
exact Grouped + Card combination. One shared pure display policy owns these applicability decisions so
Settings visibility and message rendering cannot drift. Regardless of that setting, selecting any
ordinary Timeline card or grouped Timeline row always opens the selected segment detail directly.
Only a Grouped/Compact card that is actually presented in Bottom Sheet mode opens the segment-list
page first; click intent is passed explicitly and is never recomputed from the raw stored preference.

Failed tool-detail content inside the shared Thinking/Tool bottom-sheet path keeps its full-width
rounded error bar and selectable text but uses a neutral gray palette: `surfaceVariant` at 55%
alpha with `onSurfaceVariant` content. It must not use `errorContainer` or `onErrorContainer`.
Ordinary generation errors remain the established neutral text-only presentation. Destructive
actions, non-sheet validation text, and unboxed image-load failures retain their own semantics.

### 8.8 Empty output and automatic handoff

Provider completion with no answer, thought, follow-up, guidance, or other successful output is an
ordinary generation error. Terminal persistence must include a nonblank error value so every
consumer can render the shared error bar.

Every Compact Run success-gates all automatic handoff, not only the no-input loop and regardless of
whether the caller is foreground UI, Task, or Loop. Its ordinary launcher installs the queue-release
suppression before the generation Job can start. Durable
SUCCESS removes exactly that Run's suppression before settlement, allowing the ordinary queue
release and then the existing queue-before-loop decision. ERROR, STOPPED, cancellation, missing or
still-active status, setup failure, launch failure, stale identity, and exceptions leave the
suppression in place; settlement consumes it without starting another Provider request.

Consecutive origin-Run and Compact-Run suppressions are counted. A single boolean is invalid because
the origin release and very fast Compact completion can settle in either order and would otherwise
consume each other's decision. Failure never clears, drops, duplicates, or reorders queued user
input; it leaves that input pending for a later explicit user action.

### 8.9 Provider-hosted output and OpenAI-compatible controls

An official OpenAI Provider or a custom Provider selected as OpenAI-compatible, together with
Responses API enabled, is sufficient to expose both `OpenAI Search` and `Service Tier` in the
conversation UI. No model-name allowlist, capability-discovery request, local capability registry,
or extra relay declaration may suppress those controls. This is a positive availability rule; it
does not redefine any separately supported Service Tier surface outside Responses.

The immutable generation snapshot freezes both choices. When OpenAI Search is enabled, the existing
OpenAI-compatible Responses request includes the native `web_search` tool. When Service Tier is
enabled, that same request includes the normalized selected `service_tier` value. The ordinary
Provider owns request serialization; UI visibility must not create a second request path.

OpenAI Responses reasoning summaries are public summary content, not raw chain-of-thought. When
thinking is enabled on an official or custom OpenAI-compatible Responses transport, the request opts
into the most detailed available summary with `reasoning.summary = auto`. Summary text deltas enter
the ordinary `ThoughtChunk` path and therefore form normal durable thinking segments and thinking
blocks. Deltas with the same `output_index` and `summary_index` remain contiguous; a change in either
index inserts exactly one blank line between summary parts. Bold text or a Markdown heading in the
current summary part supplies the thinking-card title with its marker removed, matching Gemini.
Disabling thinking suppresses both the summary request and its presentation.

Provider-hosted tools use non-executing hosted-tool stream events. They may create and settle durable
ordinary tool segments, but they cannot authorize local execution, enter the tool-effect reducer, or
fabricate a tool-result continuation round. Whether a durable hosted segment is presented is an
independent UI policy. Provider semantic termination still owns whether the request succeeded; Stop
and errors use the shared generation settlement.

Structured Provider citations follow [citations.md](citations.md). Protocol routers emit structured
citation events rather than answer `TextChunk` or tool events. The existing streaming segment
overlay and bounded checkpoint/terminal persistence retain accepted citation segments for the
identified Run, while Provider history and token/context projection exclude them. Citations do not
create a second generation lifecycle, change semantic termination, or append synthetic source text
to the durable answer.

A message card with visible tool segments but no real `thought` segment displays only
`Called x tools`. Message-level thought duration is a fallback only when at least one thought segment
exists; it must not turn a tool-only card into `Thought for xs, called x tools`.
Gemini keeps its hosted output protocol-local. Candidate `groundingMetadata` becomes a completed,
durable `google_search` hosted block with normalized `results` and full grounding metadata. The shared
UI segment-preparation boundary excludes that exact tool name from compact, grouped timeline,
ordinary timeline, and thinking-detail presentation, so it produces neither a `Google Search` card
nor a `Called x tools` count; generic `web_search`, OpenAI `openai_search`, and other tools remain
visible. This presentation rule does not change request serialization, hosted-tool settlement,
persistence, replay, citation extraction, source order, or failure behavior. An `executableCode` part
starts a visible `code_execution` block displayed as `Code Execution`; the matching
`codeExecutionResult` completes that same block. Code and output are not duplicated into answer text.
Persisted Code Execution segments replay to later Gemini requests as typed executable-code and
code-execution-result model parts in their original order. Multiple pairs remain ordered, and an
unmatched executable-code part leaves a tool in flight so semantic termination fails closed.

If the official service, selected model, or compatible relay rejects `web_search`,
`service_tier`, reasoning summary, or the Responses request itself, that failure is an ordinary
generation error. Persist the provider's bounded error text and render it through the existing red
error bar. Do not silently retry without the parameter, fall back to Chat Completions or generic Web
Search, auto-disable a setting, show the generated response as an error, or use a Snackbar-only or
parallel error presentation.

### 8.10 Provider reuse and mandatory minimum-abstraction rule

Official endpoints and compatible relays reuse the existing Provider implementation selected by the
wire protocol. A relay carrying Claude or Gemini models through an OpenAI-compatible wire contract
uses the OpenAI path; model branding must not select a second lifecycle or an Anthropic/Gemini
transport. Endpoint, authentication, and proven compatibility differences should remain constructor
parameters, existing configuration fields, or narrow overrides whenever those mechanisms are
sufficient.

Provider work must not create a general object model merely to make OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini
look structurally identical. Their request encoding, authentication, stream state machine,
signature/history replay, and terminal proof may remain direct protocol-local code. Reuse is
required at the existing generation lifecycle, semantic `StreamEvent`, message/tool projection, and
proven shared utility boundaries; wire-level uniformity is not a goal.

The following are binding review blockers:

- Do not add `ProviderDescriptor`, `ProviderCapabilities`, transport/policy/strategy objects,
  adapter layers, wrapper configs, factories, or interfaces by default. A proposed name or diagram
  is not evidence that an abstraction is needed.
- Do not move existing booleans or fields into a new data object merely to make the configuration
  appear cleaner. One owner and one consumer should normally remain a direct field, parameter, or
  protocol-local condition.
- A new object or interface is allowed only when the task record and review identify a cohesive
  invariant it owns, a real external/transactional side-effect boundary it isolates, or multiple
  genuine stable consumers. They must also state why the existing owner plus parameters is unsafe or
  insufficient and which existing responsibility or duplication will be removed.
- A refactor that only adds indirection, pass-through calls, mirrored types, mapping layers, or
  speculative extension points is invalid. Net object growth requires an explicit reduction in
  ownership ambiguity, duplicated behavior, or failure surface.
- Capability handling should stay as the smallest direct check in the owning Provider/configuration
  path until several real features need the exact same rule. Unknown relay behavior fails closed;
  that alone does not justify a capability framework.

### 8.11 Conversation share projection

Every conversation-sharing mode—whole conversation, selected visible messages, and one assistant
generation—uses one public-content formatter. The exported Markdown must omit every structured
`thought` segment, every `tool` segment and all of its names, arguments, progress, results, images,
and protocol metadata, legacy `MessageEntity.thoughts`, and synthetic tool/result protocol rows.
This is a read-only projection rule: sharing never deletes, rewrites, or weakens durable history,
Provider context, tool continuation state, or fork graph completeness.

The formatter preserves the selected visible branch and established ordering, completion checks,
conversation title, user text and attachment summaries, assistant answer and transcription content,
and error content. Inline text versus Markdown-file transport, share selection, and Android chooser
behavior remain transport/UI concerns and may not reintroduce private Thinking or tool payloads.

## 9. Context assembly contract in module terms

`GenerationApiPathBuilder` receives one immutable durable snapshot and a requested parent ID. It
walks only that parent chain, stops at the first successful Compact encountered upward, expands
protocol side chains without duplication, and projects Room entities once. The shared immediate
pre-Provider projection then applies image/user-template transforms and appends an optional frozen
API-only initial USER prompt. For Compact that prompt is mandatory and therefore the final request
item is USER even when the durable parent is Assistant; ordinary requests without such a configured
prompt remain unchanged.

The API-only USER prompt is counted as fixed request cost so threshold and rollout accounting cannot
omit bytes that dispatch sends. It is appended only to the initial Provider request and is not part
of retained-message calculation, Room history, generation-boundary grouping, or later tool rounds.

A Compact preflight may call this read-only ordinary builder to calculate retained-summary text.
That projection is not authoritative input for execution and cannot replace or suppress the
ordinary Provider request rebuild inside the shared generation tail.

A branch-selection change, missing parent, or corrupt chain must fail closed or produce only the
reachable safe prefix. It must never jump to a Compact on another branch.

## 10. Concurrency and failure-safety principles

1. **Single process authority.** Only the conversation mailbox/reducer accepts lifecycle
   transitions. Controllers execute accepted effects; they do not maintain shadow state.
2. **One durable live Run.** The Room active-slot constraint and transactional preconditions are
   mandatory. A fresh Run is inserted only when no other live Run exists.
3. **Fresh identity per admission.** Run IDs are generated before the durable transaction and never
   reused to restart terminal work.
4. **Identity fencing.** Asynchronous Provider, tool, checkpoint, Stop, and finalization results are
   accepted only for the expected conversation, owner token, Run, pass, and effect ID.
5. **Durable-before-external.** Provider execution begins only after the Run/message graph commits
   and the process state binds that exact Run.
6. **Terminal-before-handoff.** Compact, queue, or loop continuation starts only after the origin
   Run's legal terminal boundary. Checkpoint writers close before terminal persistence.
7. **Short lock scope.** Queue mutexes and graph/selection locks protect only decisions and
   transactions; never hold them across Provider streams, tool execution, or UI waits.
8. **Revalidation.** UI-derived targets, parent links, terminal status, Run ownership, and selected
   edges are re-read inside the serialized/transactional boundary.
9. **Atomic replacement.** Same-row fresh-Run substitution either updates the target and Run graph
   completely or changes nothing. Non-target message rows are immutable inputs.
10. **Cancellation robustness.** Cancellation cannot strand a SENDING row, lose a claimed queue
    lease, reopen a terminal Run, or bypass both coroutine and durable settlement barriers. A Stop
    persistence failure keeps the slot occupied; only after that exact failure is recorded may a
    later Stop reissue the same finalization effect identity. Concurrent duplicates and stale
    identities remain rejected. If cancellation or failure is delivered at a suspending Run-graph
    commit boundary, the owner must re-read the exact proposed Run before treating the transaction
    as uncommitted or allowing the process slot to release.
11. **Bounded persistence.** Final transforms may change only declared presentation text and the
    shared persistence guard is reapplied afterward.
12. **Fail closed.** Missing/cyclic parents, shared legacy Runs that cannot be substituted safely,
    selection drift, stale identity, and partial transaction results reject the operation rather
    than guessing or broadening mutation scope.

## 11. Abstraction and growth principles

- Prefer an existing ordinary owner over a new feature layer. Configuration data and target
  parameters are preferred to another controller/state machine.
- Keep a rule pure when it is pure. Boundary and presentation policies should be deterministic
  functions with focused tests.
- Extract a module only when it owns a cohesive invariant, a real external/transactional side
  effect boundary, or multiple genuine consumers. Do not create pass-through wrappers, type
  aliases, one-call factories, or speculative interfaces.
- Conversely, do not let a simple owner grow into unrelated responsibilities. If a file starts
  mixing admission, context, Provider execution, persistence, and UI policy, split along the
  ownership table above rather than by arbitrary line count.
- Durable fields such as `parentId`, `runId`, status, and selected edges drive generic policy.
  Message prefixes may identify presentation/protocol types but must not create parallel lifecycle
  semantics.
- Compatibility handling belongs at the narrow read/transaction boundary and must not pollute the
  normal path. New writes obey current contracts; unsafe legacy states fail closed.
- Comments explain ownership and invariants, not a second algorithm. Tests assert observable
  contracts, not source spelling.
- No architecture claim is complete until focused concurrency/failure tests, both flavor unit
  suites, the project source-size/architecture gates, and the required build succeed.

## 12. Required verification ownership

| Contract | Minimum focused proof |
|---|---|
| Generation grouping | Real USER hard boundaries; same-Run protocol/assistant rows remain one group; every Run transition separates groups; blank legacy IDs are safe. |
| Action/status projection | Every real USER has actions; only each Run group's terminal ordinary assistant has assistant actions/status; different Runs remain separate. |
| Fresh-Run admission | Send, queue drain, Compact, Recompact, and Regenerate never restart a terminal Run. |
| Context boundary | Parent-chain nearest successful Compact wins; closer ERROR/STOPPED/SENDING Compact is ignored; off-branch Compact is unreachable. |
| Recompact isolation | Same message ID/parent, fresh Run, unchanged selections and byte-for-byte unchanged non-target message rows/suffix. |
| Delete isolation | Target-only delete, direct-child reparent, unchanged surviving rows, independent Run presentation. |
| Priority | Only Compact SUCCESS permits handoff; then pending and already-claimed queue guidance beat loop and the no-guidance path admits loop once. ERROR/STOPPED/cancellation/anomaly starts neither. |
| Request terminal role | Compact dispatch appends one non-durable initial USER invocation after an Assistant or tool-result parent; provider-visible input ends USER and fixed token accounting includes it. |
| Provider-hosted output | OpenAI-compatible Responses requests serialize enabled `web_search`, selected `service_tier`, and reasoning summaries; summary indices preserve part boundaries and headings supply titles; OpenAI Search and Gemini Google Search/Code Execution settle display-only tool blocks without local execution; Gemini Code Execution replays typed parts and fails closed when a result is missing. |
| Races and failures | Stop before/after bind, consecutive origin/Compact release suppressions in both settlement orders, selection drift, missing target/status, transaction rollback, stale callbacks, checkpoint-versus-terminal ordering, and queue claim failure. |
| UI stability | Compact row/pill vertical bounds do not change across progress and terminal content; entrance is draw-only and does not alter apparent vertical spacing; error colors match the shared error bar theme tokens and alpha. |
